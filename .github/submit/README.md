This folder contains all necessary scripts for on-cluster unittesting.
If you copy this folder to your project, you should be set.
Requirements:
- there should be a `setup.py`
- tests shall be in `tests/`
- databricks connect needs to be set up.

The scripts were cleaned up to contain no reference to atc-dataplatform 
library names. Please let us know if you needed any major modifications 
to get this to work.
